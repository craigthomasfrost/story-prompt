Share a story about a time when you had to say goodbye to someone or something, but the words remained unspoken. What was the context of this farewell, and what emotions accompanied this silent departure?

Consider the lessons learned about the power of words left unsaid, the ways we hold onto memories, and the journey of finding peace in silent goodbyes.
