Share a story about a time when guidance or inspiration came from an unlikely source, someone you didn't initially see as a mentor. What was the situation, and how did this mentorship unfold? Reflect on how this unexpected mentor influenced your path, decisions, or perspective. Consider the lessons learned about openness, gratitude, and the surprising impact of learning from those we least expect to.
