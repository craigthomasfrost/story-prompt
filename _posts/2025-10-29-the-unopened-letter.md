Share a story about a letter you received but never opened, and the mystery or emotions surrounding it. What was the context of receiving this letter, and what prevented you from breaking its seal? Reflect on the significance of unopened communication and the stories or meanings left unexplored. Consider the lessons learned about curiosity, restraint, and the possible impact of unresolved moments in our lives.
