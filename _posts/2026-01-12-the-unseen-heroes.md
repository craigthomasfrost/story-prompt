Share a story about a time when you discovered the quiet impact of someone whose contributions went unnoticed or uncelebrated. Who were they, and what did they do to shape a moment, community, or your personal journey? Reflect on the emotions and appreciations that emerged from recognizing their value, and how it reshaped your understanding of the often-invisible efforts that create positive change. Consider the lessons learned about acknowledgment, gratitude, and the hidden forces that enrich our lives and worlds.
