Share a story about a dream or aspiration you once held dearly but somehow lost sight of over time. What was the dream, and how did it slip away from your focus? Reflect on the emotions and realizations that arise when thinking about this forgotten dream, and how it might have influenced the course of your life. Consider the lessons learned about priorities, the nature of ambition, and the potential to rekindle old passions when least expected.
