Share a story about a moment when you realized you owed someone an apology that you never gave. What was the situation, and what prevented you from expressing your remorse? Reflect on how this unresolved apology has affected your relationship with that person or others, and what it taught you about accountability and healing. Consider how the weight of this unsaid 'I'm sorry' has influenced your approach to conflict and repair.
