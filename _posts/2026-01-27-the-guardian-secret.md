Share a story about a time when someone quietly protected or stood guard for you, unbeknownst to you at the time. Who was this guardian, and what were the circumstances surrounding their silent support? Reflect on the emotions and insights that arose upon discovering their watchful presence, and how it influenced your feelings of safety or gratitude. Consider the lessons learned about unseen protection, the quiet acts of care from those around us, and the impact of knowing someone has your back even when you're unaware.
