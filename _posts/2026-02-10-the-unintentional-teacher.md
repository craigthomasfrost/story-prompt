Share a story about a time when you accidentally taught someone a valuable lesson or skill. What were the circumstances that led to this unintentional teaching moment, and how did it unfold? Reflect on the emotions and insights that arose from realizing the impact of your influence, and how it altered your perception of teaching or learning. Consider the lessons learned about the roles of teacher and student, the power of inadvertent guidance, and the ways in which we can inspire others without even trying.
