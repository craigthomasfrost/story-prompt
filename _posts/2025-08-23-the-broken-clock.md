Share a story about a time when you felt stuck in a moment that seemed to never end. What was happening in your life at that time, and why did it feel so stagnant? Reflect on the emotions and realizations that emerged from this period of stillness, and how you eventually moved forward. Consider the lasting impact this 'frozen' time had on your journey and perception of change.
