Share a story about a promise you made to someone or yourself that, over time, slipped from your memory but later resurfaced with importance. What was the promise, and what reminded you of it? Reflect on how keeping or breaking this promise has affected your personal journey, relationships, or self-awareness. Consider the lessons learned about commitment, responsibility, and how intentions echo through time, influencing us in ways we had not predicted.
