Share a story about a time when you rediscovered a path or place from your past that you had long forgotten. What led you back, and how did revisiting this place or path impact you emotionally? Reflect on the memories that resurfaced and the emotions that were rekindled. Consider the lessons learned about memory, the passage of time, and the connections that remain tethered to forgotten places and paths.
