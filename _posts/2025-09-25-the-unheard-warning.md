Share a story about a moment when someone tried to warn you about something important, but you didn't listen or realize its significance until later. What was the warning about, who gave it, and why did you initially dismiss it? Reflect on the consequences of not heeding this warning and how it has influenced your approach to advice and foresight. Consider the lessons learned about listening and the impact of hindsight on your journey.
