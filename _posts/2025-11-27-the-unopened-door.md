Share a story about a door you never opened, literally or metaphorically, and the mystery or opportunities that remained hidden. What was behind this door, and what kept you from exploring it? Reflect on the impact of this unchosen path on your life and the shadow of 'what if' that lingers. Consider the lessons learned about curiosity, fear, and the decisions we make about the unknown.
