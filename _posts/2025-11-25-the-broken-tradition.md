Share a story about a tradition that was unexpectedly interrupted or broken, leaving a lasting impact on you or your community. What was the tradition, and how did its discontinuation come about? Reflect on the emotions and reflections that arose from this break, and how it altered perceptions of continuity and change. Consider the lessons learned about adaptation, the significance of traditions, and the potential for new beginnings even in the absence of the old ways.
