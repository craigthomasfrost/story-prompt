Share a story about a time when someone you least expected stood up for you or supported you during a challenging moment. Who was this unexpected ally, and what impact did their support have on the situation and your relationship? Reflect on how their advocacy changed your perspective on the people around you and the bonds formed in unexpected places. Consider the lessons learned about trust, empathy, and human connection.
