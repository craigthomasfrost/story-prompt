Share a story about a moment when you found yourself unexpectedly in a position to help others, even when you didn't consider yourself capable. What situation called you to action, and how did you overcome self-doubt to become a source of support or protection? Reflect on the emotions and realizations that emerged from stepping into this unanticipated role. Consider the lessons learned about courage, the potential within, and the impact of rising to the occasion when least expected.
