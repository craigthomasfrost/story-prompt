Share a story about a time when you inadvertently became a mentor to someone, or someone became a mentor to you without either of you realizing it at first. Who was involved, and how did this mentorship unfold? Reflect on the growth, insights, and mutual influence that resulted from this unintentional guidance. Consider the lessons learned about leadership, reciprocity, and the unexpected ways we can impact and be impacted by others in our journeys.
