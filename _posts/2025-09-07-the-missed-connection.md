Share a story about a time when you almost met someone or experienced something that you believe could have changed your life. What were the circumstances that led to this missed connection, and how did it make you feel at the time? Reflect on how imagining the possibilities of what could have been has influenced your thoughts, decisions, or outlook on life. Consider what this moment taught you about timing, fate, or opportunity.
