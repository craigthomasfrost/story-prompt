Share a story about a time when you turned down an invitation or opportunity that you later wondered about or regretted. What was offered to you, and what made you say no at that time? Reflect on how this decision has lingered in your thoughts and how it has influenced your approach to saying yes or no in the future. Consider the lessons learned about opportunity, regret, and taking risks.
