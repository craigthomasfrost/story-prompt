Share a story about finally receiving an apology you had been hoping for or offering one that had been long overdue. What was the past event or misunderstanding that lingered unresolved, and what eventually prompted the apology to be given? Reflect on the emotions and closure experienced during this moment of reconciliation, and how it influenced your relationships or self-healing. Consider the lessons learned about forgiveness, the wounds of silence, and the transformative power of owning up to past mistakes.
