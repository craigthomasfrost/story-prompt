Share a story about a constant presence in your life that you hadn't fully acknowledged until recently. Who or what is this companion, and how has it supported or influenced you without your conscious recognition? Reflect on the realization of their impact and how it reshapes your past experiences and future engagements. Consider the lessons learned about awareness and gratitude.
