Share a story about a time when you faced a challenge but chose to keep it to yourself rather than seek support or advice. What was the nature of this challenge, and why did you decide to face it alone? Reflect on the impact of handling it independently on your growth or outcome. Consider the lessons learned about self-reliance, the boundaries of pride, and the times when silence is both empowering and isolating.
